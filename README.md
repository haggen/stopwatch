# Stopwatch

> https://stopwatch.crz.li

- Clean, responsive and minimalist design, fit for embedding or full-screen displays.
- Local-stored, persistent state -- if you close and reopen the same URL it'll still be running.
- Keyboard accessible: `↑`, `↓` for editing, `space bar` to play/pause and `backspace` to clear.
- Works great embedded in 📔[Notion](https://notion.so).
